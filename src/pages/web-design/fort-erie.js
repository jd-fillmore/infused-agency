                What is web design, and why is it important for my business?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Web design is the process of creating the look and feel of your
                website. A well-designed website helps attract visitors, keep
                them engaged, and convert them into customers.
              </p>

              <h3>How long does it take to design a website?</h3>
              <p>
                The time it takes depends on the complexity of the site and your
                requirements. Typically, a website can take anywhere from a few
                weeks to a couple of months to complete.
              </p>

              <h3>What is responsive web design?</h3>
              <p>
                Responsive web design ensures your website looks great and
                functions well on any device, from phones to desktops.
              </p>

              <h3>How much does web design in Fort Erie cost?</h3>
              <p>
                The cost of web design depends on the scope of the project.{" "}

              <h3>Do I need a custom website or a template-based design?</h3>
              <p>
                A custom website is tailored to your business, offering a unique
                design and functionality. Template designs are quicker and less
                expensive but can lack originality.
              </p>

              <h3>Will my website be easy to update after it's built?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes! We build websites that are easy to update, especially if
                you're using a content management system (CMS) like WordPress,
                so you can add or change content without hassle.
              </p>

              <h3>Can you redesign my current website?</h3>
              <p>
                Absolutely! We specialize in redesigning websites to make them
                more modern, user-friendly, and optimized for performance and
                search engines.
              </p>

                Erie business?
              </h3>
              <p>
                A well-designed website helps build trust with visitors,
                improves user experience, and can lead to more conversions and
                business growth.
              </p>

              <h3>What happens after my website is launched?</h3>
              <p>
                After launch, we offer ongoing support, maintenance, and updates
                to keep your website running smoothly and up-to-date with the
                latest features.
