                        In just one month, my business's website made it to the
                        first page of Google! I was so surprised! After that, I
                        started getting emails from people interested in my
                        services right away, and I've been busy ever since!
                        Thanks a lot to Infused Agency for helping my business
                        grow!

                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>
                      KD Flowers didn't have a website, so people couldn't find
                      them online. They wanted to grow their business and get
                      new customers from Google searches.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How We Helped</h2>
                    <p>
                      We made a cool new website for KD Flowers that's easy for
                      people to use. It looks great and works on both phones and
                      computers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      After we finished the website, we helped more people find
                      it. We used something called "local SEO" to make sure KD
                      Flowers showed up when people in their area searched for
                      flower shops on Google.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What Happened Next</h2>
                    <p>
                      Since we put up the new website, KD Flowers has gotten
                      lots of new customers! Their website looks amazing, and
                      now they show up at the top of Google searches in their
                      area.

                      site and can go up to $1,000 a month (for one year) or

                    <h3>How much input do I have?</h3>
                    <p>
                      A lot! Itâ€™s like building with Lego â€“ weâ€™ll work together
