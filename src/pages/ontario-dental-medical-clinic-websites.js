                    <h3>How long will it take to get a new website?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Typically between 6 and 8 weeks. Keep in mind this
                      completely depends on the client, though. For example - if
                      we need content or approval from you and there are
                      potential delays, this could delay the launch. However if
                      you send over content / approval for things along the way
                      quickly, the more quick your website will launch.

                    <h3>Do you only create WordPress websites?</h3>
                    <p>
                      No. WordPress is great for a lot of use cases. You can
                      update your website on your own without needing a
                      developer (we teach you). There's a rich ecosystem of
                      plugins we utilize to speed up development. However,
                      sometimes a hand-coded website far outperforms a WordPress
                      site depending on the situation.
